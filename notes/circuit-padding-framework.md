# Tor's Circuit Padding Framework 
Notes taken when reading through Tor's circuit padding framework, starting from
tag `tor-0.4.1.3-alpha` at https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/.

Important files added largely for the circuit padding framework:
- `src/core/or/circuitpadding.{h,c}`, 1916 lines of code and 1420 lines of comments.
- `src/core/or/circuitpadding_machines.{h,c}`, 185 lines of code and 232 lines of comments.
- `src/lib/math/prob_distr.{h,c}`, 658 lines of code and 1099 lines of comments. 

That's a significant amount of complexity added to the core of tor. In
comparison, the `src/core/crypto` directory consists of 1389 lines of code (sans
libraries for primitives). 

## Background
We briefly cover necessary background here. 

### State Machines
A state machine consists of _states_ and _transitions_ between those states.
Transitions occur due to _events_ or when conditions are met. The [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine#Concepts_and_terminology)
gives more details.

### Circuits in Tor
A circuit is the core construct in Tor for building connections between relays.
Circuits have different _purposes_ depending on on their intended use, e.g., as
part of onion services or for general purpose use. Constants for the different
purposes are found in `src/core/or/circuitlist.h`, in total 24 different valid
purposes, mostly dealing with client-server roles related to onion services. TCP
streams are multiplexed inside a circuit as part of a _stream_, and typical
operation of tor involves the frequent connection of both circuits and streams,
just like regular TCP streams. 

## What is a "Machine"?
A machine is a state machine that exists _per circuit_, hence a "circuit padding
framework". A padding machine injects fake (padding) cells with different
goals in mind, such as hiding from a passive network adversary the purpose of a
circuit (e.g., distinguishing between "regular" circuits and onion services). 

`circuitpadding.h` reads bottom-up, so to answer what a machine is we go more
top-down here. There a three primary structs for a machine:
- `circpad_machine_spec_t` The global specification of a machine, immutable.
- `circpad_state_t` Global immutable description of a state and its possible
  transitions as part of a machine.
- `circpad_machine_runtime_t` Per circuit description of the state machine with
  _mutable_ data, kept as small as possible for sake of minimizing memory usage.

So a machine consists of one `circpad_machine_spec_t` that specifies a number of
states and their transitions (`circpad_state_t`), all immutable. For each
circuit, one `circpad_machine_runtime_t` consists mutable data, such as the
current state of the machine on the circuit. 

### Details on `circpad_machine_spec_t`

#### Conditions for Being Active
A machine is only active on a circuit if specific _conditions_ are
met, as shown below:

```c
typedef struct circpad_machine_conditions_t {
  /** Only apply the machine *if* the circuit has at least this many hops */
  unsigned min_hops : 3;

  /** Only apply the machine *if* vanguards are enabled */
  unsigned requires_vanguards : 1;

  /**
   * This machine is ok to use if reduced padding is set in consensus
   * or torrc. This machine will still be applied even if reduced padding
   * is not set; this flag only acts to exclude machines that don't have
   * it set when reduced padding is requested. Therefore, reduced padding
   * machines should appear at the lowest priority in the padding machine
   * lists (aka first in the list), so that non-reduced padding machines
   * for the same purpose are given a chance to apply when reduced padding
   * is not requested. */
  unsigned reduced_padding_ok : 1;

  /** Only apply the machine *if* the circuit's state matches any of
   *  the bits set in this bitmask. */
  circpad_circuit_state_t state_mask;

  /** Only apply a machine *if* the circuit's purpose matches one
   *  of the bits set in this bitmask */
  circpad_purpose_mask_t purpose_mask;

} circpad_machine_conditions_t;
```

The purpose of the circuit is encoded is `purpose_mask`, as discussed earlier,
and `state_mask` covers the state of the circuit:

```c
typedef enum {
  /* Only apply machine if the circuit is still building */
  CIRCPAD_CIRC_BUILDING = 1<<0,
  /* Only apply machine if the circuit is open */
  CIRCPAD_CIRC_OPENED = 1<<1,
  /* Only apply machine if the circuit has no attached streams */
  CIRCPAD_CIRC_NO_STREAMS = 1<<2,
  /* Only apply machine if the circuit has attached streams */
  CIRCPAD_CIRC_STREAMS = 1<<3,
  /* Only apply machine if the circuit still allows RELAY_EARLY cells */
  CIRCPAD_CIRC_HAS_RELAY_EARLY = 1<<4,
  /* Only apply machine if the circuit has depleted its RELAY_EARLY cells
   * allowance. */
  CIRCPAD_CIRC_HAS_NO_RELAY_EARLY = 1<<5
} circpad_circuit_state_t;
```
This allows us quite some control over when a machine should be active on a
circuit.

### Details on `circpad_state_t`

To sample delays machines can use:
- histograms with or without token removal, or 
- probability distributions.

...

- We can transition due to events, can we also transition for other reasons?

#### Histograms
A [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) is an estimation of a
probability distribution, so if the padding framework supports directly using
several probability distributions, why add support for histograms? The answer is
due to the idea of [adaptive
padding](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_esorics06.pdf) as part of the
paper [Toward an Efficient Website Fingerprinting
Defense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00524.pdf) by Juarez _et al._. The idea is
to adapt _when_ to inject padding such that the resulting inter-arrival time
(IAT) of _all_ packets (cells) are shaped according to two histograms: one for
for IAT within _bursts_ of traffic and one for IAT _between_ bursts. 

With the above in mind, we can first see the histogram definition as part of the
immutable `circpad_state_t`:

```c
/**
   * If a histogram is used for this state, this specifies the number of bins
   * of this histogram. Histograms must have at least 2 bins.
   *
   * In particular, the following histogram:
   *
   * Tokens
   *         +
   *      10 |    +----+
   *       9 |    |    |           +---------+
   *       8 |    |    |           |         |
   *       7 |    |    |     +-----+         |
   *       6 +----+ Bin+-----+     |         +---------------+
   *       5 |    | #1 |     |     |         |               |
   *         | Bin|    | Bin | Bin |  Bin #4 |    Bin #5     |
   *         | #0 |    | #2  | #3  |         | (infinity bin)|
   *         |    |    |     |     |         |               |
   *         |    |    |     |     |         |               |
   *       0 +----+----+-----+-----+---------+---------------+
   *         0   100  200   350   500      1000              âˆž  microseconds
   *
   * would be specified the following way:
   *    histogram_len = 6;
   *    histogram[] =        {   6,  10,   6,  7,    9,     6 }
   *    histogram_edges[] =  { 0, 100, 200, 350, 500, 1000 }
   *
   * The final bin is called the "infinity bin" and if it's chosen we don't
   * schedule any padding. The infinity bin is strange because its lower edge
   * is the max value of possible non-infinite delay allowed by this histogram,
   * and its upper edge is CIRCPAD_DELAY_INFINITE. You can tell if the infinity
   * bin is chosen by inspecting its bin index or inspecting its upper edge.
   *
   * If a delay probability distribution is used for this state, this is set
   * to 0. */
  circpad_hist_index_t histogram_len;
  /** The histogram itself: an array of uint16s of tokens, whose
   *  widths are exponentially spaced, in microseconds.
   *
   *  This array must have histogram_len elements that are strictly
   *  monotonically increasing. */
  circpad_hist_token_t histogram[CIRCPAD_MAX_HISTOGRAM_LEN];
  /* The histogram bin edges in usec.
   *
   * Each element of this array specifies the left edge of the corresponding
   * bin. The rightmost edge is always infinity and is not specified in this
   * array.
   *
   * This array must have histogram_len elements. */
  circpad_delay_t histogram_edges[CIRCPAD_MAX_HISTOGRAM_LEN+1];
  /** Total number of tokens in this histogram. This is a constant and is *not*
   *  decremented every time we spend a token. It's used for initializing and
   *  refilling the histogram. */
  uint32_t histogram_total_tokens;

  ...

    /** This specifies the token removal strategy to use upon padding and
   *  non-padding activity. */
  circpad_removal_t token_removal;
```

The token removal strategy is the key part of the use of histograms over
probability distributions: 

```c
/**
 * Token removal strategy options.
 *
 * The WTF-PAD histograms are meant to specify a target distribution to shape
 * traffic towards. This is accomplished by removing tokens from the histogram
 * when either padding or non-padding cells are sent.
 *
 * When we see a non-padding cell at a particular time since the last cell, you
 * remove a token from the corresponding delay bin. These flags specify
 * which bin to choose if that bin is already empty.
 */
typedef enum {
  /** Don't remove any tokens */
  CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_NONE = 0,
  /**
   * Remove from the first non-zero higher bin index when current is zero.
   * This is the recommended strategy from the Adaptive Padding paper. */
  CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_HIGHER = 1,
  /** Remove from the first non-zero lower bin index when current is empty. */
  CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_LOWER = 2,
  /** Remove from the closest non-zero bin index when current is empty. */
  CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_CLOSEST = 3,
  /** Remove from the closest bin by time value (since bins are
   *  exponentially spaced). */
  CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_CLOSEST_USEC = 4,
  /** Only remove from the exact bin corresponding to this delay. If
   *  the bin is 0, simply do nothing. Don't pick another bin. */
  CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_EXACT = 5
} circpad_removal_t;
```

#### Probability Distributions
There are support for the following distributions:
```c
/**
 * Distribution types supported by circpad_distribution_sample().
 *
 * These can be used instead of histograms for the inter-packet
 * timing distribution, or to specify a distribution on the number
 * of cells that can be sent while in a specific state of the state
 * machine.
 *
 * Each distribution takes up to two parameters which are described below. */
typedef enum {
  /* No probability distribution is used */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_NONE = 0,
  /* Uniform distribution: param1 is lower bound and param2 is upper bound */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_UNIFORM = 1,
  /* Logistic distribution: param1 is Mu, param2 is sigma. */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_LOGISTIC = 2,
  /* Log-logistic distribution: param1 is Alpha, param2 is 1.0/Beta */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_LOG_LOGISTIC = 3,
  /* Geometric distribution: param1 is 'p' (success probability) */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_GEOMETRIC = 4,
  /* Weibull distribution: param1 is k, param2 is Lambda */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_WEIBULL = 5,
  /* Generalized Pareto distribution: param1 is sigma, param2 is xi */
  CIRCPAD_DIST_PARETO = 6
} circpad_distribution_type_t;

/**
 * Distribution information.
 *
 * This type specifies a specific distribution above, as well as
 * up to two parameters for that distribution. The specific
 * per-distribution meaning of these parameters is specified
 * in circpad_distribution_sample().
 */
typedef struct circpad_distribution_t {
  circpad_distribution_type_t type;
  double param1;
  double param2;
} circpad_distribution_t;
```

The distribution for IAT is selected for a machine as part of the immutable
`circpad_state_t`:

```c
  /**
   * Represents a delay probability distribution (aka IAT distribution). It's a
   * parametrized way of encoding inter-packet delay information in
   * microseconds. It can be used instead of histograms.
   *
   * If it is used, token_removal below must be set to
   * CIRCPAD_TOKEN_REMOVAL_NONE.
   *
   * Start_usec, range_sec, and rtt_estimates are still applied to the
   * results of sampling from this distribution (range_sec is used as a max).
   */
  circpad_distribution_t iat_dist;
  /*  If a delay probability distribution is used, this is used as the max
   *  value we can sample from the distribution. However, RTT measurements and
   *  dist_added_shift gets applied on top of this value to derive the final
   *  padding delay. */
  circpad_delay_t dist_max_sample_usec;
  /*  If a delay probability distribution is used and this is set, we will add
   *  this value on top of the value sampled from the IAT distribution to
   *  derive the final padding delay (We also add the RTT measurement if it's
   *  enabled.). */
  circpad_delay_t dist_added_shift_usec;
```

## Current Machines
In `circuitpadding_machines.{h.c}` we find two machines that adds padding with the
goal of hiding IP and RP circuits, as used for onion services. In gist: 

- The IP hiding machine injects two cells on IP circuit creation on the client
  side, sending them to middle relay. After the the middle relay gets any
  non-padding cells to send to the client, it in turn uniformly random every
  [1,10] ms sends a padding cell to the client, up to a total of uniformly
  random [7,10] padding cells have been sent. 
- The RP hiding machine ...
