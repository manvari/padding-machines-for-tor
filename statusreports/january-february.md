During January and February:
- Completed two runs of dataset collection and publicly released it as the
  [Goodenough](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/dataset)
  dataset.
- Shared [updated
  tools](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/collect-traces)
  used to collect the dataset, as well as detailed steps for repeating the
  collection and tools for extracting
  [circpad-sim](https://github.com/pylls/circpad-sim) traces.
- Shared a [comprehensive evaluation
  script](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/tree/master/evaluation),
  including a port of [Deep
  Fingerprinting](https://github.com/deep-fingerprinting/df) to PyTorch.
- Shared [an example machine](https://github.com/pylls/padding-machines-for-tor/blob/master/machines/hello-world.md) that was designed, implemented, evaluated, and documented (internal grant Milestone).
- Made good progress on effective machines, completion of the project during
  spring 2020 seems totally doable. Will be shared later.
