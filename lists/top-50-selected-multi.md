# top-50-selected-multi list
This document describes how the top-50-selected-multi.list file was created. Had
to get to Alexa rank 212. 

## How created
Approach for the list is simple but boring. Starting from the top of the Alexa
top-list, asking two questions to decide if we include the site or not:
- Is the site reliable to visit over Tor? That is, not behind some cloudwall or
  blacklist? Also, does it load reliably. 
- Does the site contain several _similar_ webpages beyond the frontpage that can
  be accessed? 

## General pruning
- remove all tracking stuff in URL that still gives the page on a clean TB
- avoid porn (for sake of work)
- try not to mix significant content types on pages, like mixing videos and text
  articles on news-site (that's two different classes)
