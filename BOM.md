# Software Bill of Materials
This is the 
[software bill of materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials) 
of the padding machines created in this project. We consider software used
during the development (like editor and OS) and experimentation out of scope.

Currently, the machines only depend on Tor's onion router software little-t tor
available at https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/ . 

A design goal for the padding machines is to not introduce further dependencies
into tor for the machines to work.
